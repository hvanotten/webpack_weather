  - the headline will be updated to reflect current location
  - you can search for the weather conditions of other locations
  - the animated weather image will change depending on the location's weather conditions

## Learning Outcomes:

The major takeaway here is that I was demonstrating how to access each part of the returned JSON data from the API response and use it in different ways to access certain information.

This is my first using SASS in a project vs just practice so I was excited to see what I could do. Had some problems with images but planning on doing some more reading and coming back to it.

I've been spending most of my time studying and learning about accessibility and screen readers. In this project i wanted to make sure I included accessibility testing and also included testing with a Screen Reader.
