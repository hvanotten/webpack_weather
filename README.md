Key take away's

the major takeaway here is that I learnt how to access each part of the returned JSON data from the API response and use it in different ways

this is my first using SASS in a project vs just practice so I was excited to see what I could do.

I've been spending a lot of time studying and learning about accessibility and screen readers. In this project i wanted to make sure I included accessibility testing and also included testing with a Screen Reader.

Did some research on hiding API keys and added a few serverless functions in order to do so



found pictures on unsplash need to add image loader to make them work. will add that after i research it.
